# Mangrove Labs Concept Paper
"Let’s make a better Miami through tech and data."

**The Issue:** While there are digital agencies in Miami, we believe there is a lack of agencies focusing on improving our community and environment through technology and design.

**Mission Statement:** Mangrove Labs aims to champion the use of open-source technology in providing and enhancing municipal services and programs for community benefit. In an area not known for civic engagement nor technical acumen, we aim to surprise and delight the diverse communities of South Florida in engaging with municipalities and organizations for social good. Our goal is a staff and client list that accurate represents the people of Miami-Dade County, annual profitability and maintaining our sense of humor.

## Market Analysis

The concept of a company such as Mangrove Labs isn’t new, but it would be new for Miami. Similar organizations in other cities include the following:

- DataMade (https://datamade.us/, Chicago)
- Compiler.LA (http://www.compiler.la/, LA)
- BetaNYC (https://beta.nyc/, NYC)

All of the above do consulting, some additionally offer specific services that are open source but offer consulting fees for project hosting and maintenance. They have been a combination of different business models; BetaNYC is a 501(c)3, while DataMade is a for-profit.

DataMade also created a 2013 list which includes [a list of civic tech consultancy groups](https://datamade.us/blog/making-a-living-with-civic-tech): Azavea, Civic Agency, Conveyal, Department of Better Technology, Development Seed, MySociety, NuCivic. As Derek Eder describes it, these companies:

> Sell customized versions of your open source project(s). The code remains open; the value is in the custom deployment. Also, sometimes build completely customized open source projects based on your open source portfolio. 

The biggest difference is Mangrove can also sell customized versions of _other_ open source projects.

### Additional challenges

- The local area is well known in its lack of civic engagement. This has been proved through research papers as well as antidotally.
- Miami-Dade has a challenging geography, with 34 municipality governments and a large unincorporated municipal service area.
  - While the concept of civic technology has been emerging through many large cities of the United States, there hasn’t been much movement in improving city services using technology within the smaller municipal areas. 
  - Miami-Dade County itself, on the other hand, is the largest government in Florida, behind the state itself. The county has data, and pride themselves on service; however internal county IT services can still be more agile. They are around 300 people or so, using multi-million dollar contracts with enterprise solutions which take years of implementation.
- Other challenges include a relatively nascent, but emerging tech community, with eager residents looking to gain experience in design and development while working on interesting challenges.

## Marketing & Sales

As of Summer 2016, Mangrove Labs is a bootstrapped organization while I drum up additional projects, case studies, and clients to be able to do devote to this work full time.

I will start by reaching out to the many contacts I met as a 2015 Code for America Fellow. I’ll focus on emphasizing that Mangrove has been created as a consultancy, highlighting previous and current projects such as The Miami-Dade CUTGroup, as well as my availability for additional services as noted above.

Some cold calling will most likely be necessary. While there are movements to make Miami better and organizations such as non-profits, Foundations, etc, many of these organizations emphasize community building and programs and may not know how technology be used to compliment their programs or improve community services directly.
