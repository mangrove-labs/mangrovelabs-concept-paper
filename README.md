## Market Analysis

The concept of a company such as Mangrove Labs isnâ€™t new, but it would be new for Miami. Similar organizations in other cities include the following:

- DataMade (https://datamade.us/, Chicago)
- Compiler.LA (http://www.compiler.la/, LA)
- BetaNYC (https://beta.nyc/, NYC)

All of the above do consulting, some additionally offer specific services that are open source but offer consulting fees for project hosting and maintenance. They have been a combination of different business models; BetaNYC is a 501(c)3, while DataMade is a for-profit.
